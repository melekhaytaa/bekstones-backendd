      <div class="fade-in-text hidden">
        <p>
          At Bek Stones, we process natural stones, sourced meticulously from various regions of Turkey, into 3â€“4 cm thick pieces to deliver the most timeless and aesthetic solution in facade cladding. All our stones are 100% natural and contain no cultured or mold-made components.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stones are applied to facades using cement-based adhesives and are finished with water-repellent, granulated joint fillers, ensuring long-lasting, durable, and natural-looking results.
        </p>
        <p>
          This system not only offers aesthetics but also significant advantages in terms of heat and water insulation. Compared to traditional methods, it can be applied much faster and is more cost-effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially with our L-shaped corner stones used at building edges, the finished application gives the appearance of full-stone masonry. It offers a strong, nostalgic, and modern architectural aesthetic.
