    <p>
      Today, energy efficiency and indoor comfort are more important than ever in building design. Facade stone cladding not only enhances visual appeal but also offers effective thermal and sound insulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Thermal Benefits of Natural Stone</h3>
    <p>
      Natural stone slows down heat transfer thanks to its high density. This helps keep interiors cool in summer and warm in winter. As a result, energy savings are achieved and heating/cooling costs are reduced.
    </p>

    <h3>Quieter Living Spaces with Sound Insulation</h3>
    <p>
      External noise from traffic, construction, or other sources can negatively impact quality of life. Stone cladding on the facade absorbs sound waves, creating a quieter indoor environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Functional and Aesthetic</h3>
    <p>
      Stone cladding doesn't just provide technical benefits — it also adds prestige and natural charm to your building. With a variety of colors, textures, and stone types available, you can find solutions for any style.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're looking for a durable and energy-efficient facade solution, natural stone cladding is an ideal choice. At Bek Stones, we’re happy to provide tailored solutions for your projects.
